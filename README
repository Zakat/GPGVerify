GPG Verify
A manually activated Script to verify signed files with GPG (see GPG homepage
http://www.gnupg.org/ )
By Levi Brown <mailto:levi@grokers.net>
Version 1.0.1 September 8th, 2011

This script works in tandem with the 'gpg' command line binary (which should
already be installed and functional) to provide a simple user interface to the
validation of signed files with a detached signature.

The intention is for this script to be accessed from the Script Menu and acts on
the current selection in the Finder.  If only one file is selected the script
will attempt to locate the matching signed file or detached signature file based
on file name.  I suggest adding this script to the Finder Scripts Folder so it
is available from the Finder as needed.  For more information about the Script
Menu please visit: http://www.apple.com/applescript/scriptmenu/

* This script has been tested on Mac OS X 10.4.7 to 10.7.1 under US English and may
contain i18n issues which are not accounted for.

Please feel free to contact me with improvements and feedback.
